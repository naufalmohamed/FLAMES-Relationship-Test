## How It Works

2. It calculates the common characters between the names and removes them.
3. The remaining unique characters are counted to determine the relationship outcome using the FLAMES logic.
4. The final result is displayed as one of the following: Friends, Lovers, Anger, Married, Enemy, or Siblings.
